__Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.__

__Describe the solution you'd like__
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

__Are you willing to implement it?__
Yes/No

__Managing expectations:__

Maintainers will not be implementing something they don't need, so if you want a feature, you will have to:

1. Explain the problem in a way that makes sense to everyone
2. Discuss a solution
3. Implement it

You can also do the first step only and wait for someone else to work on the implementation. Anything is much better than nothing.
